# RL Experiment Tracking Platform

All of the files within this directory are for my system project building out a platform to use for Reinforcement Learning experiments. Rather than duplicate information please see the Jupyter notebook [SystemProjectWalkthrough.ipynb](SystemProjectWalkthrough.ipynb) for a detailed explanation of the project.

In addition to the notebook there is a `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image that can be used to run all of the code.

The code is all in the `code` directory and was based off of CleanRL implemented reinforcement algorithms.
