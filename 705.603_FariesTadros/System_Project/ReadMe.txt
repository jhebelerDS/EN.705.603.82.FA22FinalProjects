For my system project there are three directories of note:
src: has source code to models (cnn_keras.py and vit_keras_net.py) by default the scripts will kick off training and validation 
util: has 2 jupyter notebooks to load data, train the models and run validation (Run_CNN.ipynb and Run_ViT.ipynb)
data: needs to contain imagery datasets, go to https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/data and download the dataset into the data folder, I could not make the data part of the repo since it is over 6GB
