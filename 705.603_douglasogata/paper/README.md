# Paper
This directory contains two main artifacts used to investigate the Characteristics of the Lorenz System with Neural-Networks:
- Document that discusses the investigation and the findings.
- Google Collab notebook implementation of NeuroDiffEq solution. The notebook also contains the numerical simulation used for comparing the solution trajectories.
